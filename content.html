<p>Many pages in the Atomic LLearning platform use Codespaces to provide a consistent, pre-configured environment for learning. These will generally open an instance of VS Code in the browser and will allow editing larger code projects without the need to download content and run it locally on your machine.</p>

<h2>Creating a Codespace</h2>

<p>In order to open a Codespace from an Atomic Learning page, click on the link at the top of the Atomic Learning content page. This will take you to a GitHub page where you can create a new Codespace, like the one below.</p>

<p>You will need to be signed into GitHub to be able to do this. The page will have several options that you won't normally need to change. Instead, click the "Create Codespace" button. The Codespace will take a few seconds to load. You should then see an interface that looks something like the one below.</p>
