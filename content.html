<p>Many pages in the Atomic LLearning platform use Codespaces to provide a consistent, pre-configured environment for learning. These will generally open an instance of VS Code in the browser and will allow editing larger code projects without the need to download content and run it locally on your machine.</p>

<p>In order to open a Codespace from an Atomic Learning page, click on the "Open Codespace Button" at the top of the page.</p>
