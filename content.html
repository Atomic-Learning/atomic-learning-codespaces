<p>Many pages in the Atomic Learning platform use Codespaces to provide a consistent, pre-configured environment for programming examples and exercises. These will generally open an instance of Visual Studio Code in the browser and will allow editing larger code projects without the need to download content and run it locally on your machine.</p>

<h2>Creating a Codespace</h2>

<p>In order to open a Codespace from an Atomic Learning page, click on the link at the top of the Atomic Learning content page. This will take you to a GitHub page where you can create a new Codespace, like the one below.</p>

<img src="/resources/create_codespace.png" alt="The interface to create a new codespace" width="600" />


<p>You will need to be signed into GitHub to be able to do this. The page will have several options that you won't normally need to change. Instead, click the "Create Codespace" button. The Codespace will take a few seconds to load. You should then see an interface that looks something like the one below.</p>

<img src="/resources/vs_code_interface.png" alt="The initial view of a Codespace in the browser." width="600" />

<p>In this interface there will be a few panels that you can often close. In the image above, the red panel is the currently open file. Depending on how the Codespace is configured, this may or may not be a useful file for the example or exercise. If it is not useful, you can close it and open the file required for the task at hand from the file explorer on the left side of the interface. The panel at the bottom of the page, outlined in blue in the image above, is the Terminal. You may need this for some exercises but, if you don't, you can close it. The panel on the right, outlined in green, is the interface for chatting with GitHub Copilot, an AI assistant that can help you write code. Unless instructed otherwise, you can close this panel as well as you will gain more from exercises by trying to write code yourself. Closing all of these panels will give you a less cluttered environment to work in.</p>

<h2>Mini-Exercise</h2>

<ul>
<li>Open the Codespace using the link at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Close the panels indicated above.</li>
<li>Visit <a href="https://github.com/codespaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/codespaces</a> and find your Codespace on the page.</li>
